In 1986 and 1987, she'd visited Nairobi for extended stays and traveled on safari during those trips. She reportedly fell in love with Kenya to the point where she wanted to eventually move there and sell jewelry made by the members of the Maasai tribe. Her seven-month-long trip in 1988 had started in February and took her from Great Britain into Spain, through the Mediterranean, into several North African countries, Uganda, Tanzania, and eventually ended in Kenya in late June. For most of July, she'd camped on Natasha and Paul's property in Nairobi because they allowed people who were traveling internationally to pitch tents on their land. The more they'd gotten to know Julie during that summer, the more they all developed a close friendship over their collective love of dogs. In August, Julie had decided to shift her living arrangement slightly and started renting that cottage from Doug Morey, who, like I mentioned earlier, lived next door to the Well Dixons. Around this time is when Julie purchased her Suzuki Jeep to get around while traveling. She also met up with three other mentioned earlier, live next door to the Well Dixons. Around this time is when Julie purchased her Suzuki Jeep to get around while traveling. She also met up with three other tourists from Australia, two of whom she knew and another whom she just met for the first time. That new person was a guy named Glenn Burns, and according to Grace Messilla's book, A Death Retold in Truth and Rumor, he and Julie had traveled from Nairobi to the reserve together on Friday, September 2nd to watch the wildebeest migration.",

The next day, Saturday, September 3rd, they traveled through the reserve but had car troubles that forced them to cut their day short. They ended up having to get towed to a nearby lodge by a local tour guide who let them borrow a tent because they'd left theirs across the park at Sand River Camp. By Sunday morning, September 4th, Julie and Glenn had come up with a plan to get Julie's Jeep fixed so they could continue on with their travels. But the only problem was the car part they needed, a new fuel pump, had to be retrieved from Nairobi, which wasn't super close by. Like I mentioned earlier, the city was more than 150 miles away from the reserve. Glenn was scheduled to go to a conference at a museum in the city the following day anyway, so he told Julie he would hop on a charter plane to the city, link up with her friend Paul Weld Dixon, and see if Paul would be willing to buy a new fuel pump and fly it back to the reserve. That plan panned out because when Glenn returned to Nairobi by the end of the day on September 4th, Paul was more than happy to assist. The next day, Monday, September 5th, the new fuel pump was on its way to Julie. When it arrived, though, it was too late in the day for a mechanic to put it in her Jeep, so she opted to spend Monday night at the lodge that she and Glenn had been towed to and just figure things out the next day.",

He told reporter Peter Godwin, quote, Kenya is a country which relies very heavily on tourism, and there may be a temptation to look the other way. If there is a man out there who killed my daughter, I want him, end quote. John's resolve was seemingly limitless, along with his ability to bankroll independent efforts to investigate what happened to Julie. He was a wealthy businessman and the managing director of a hotel group, so it's no surprise that from day one he was able to contract several private pilots and aircrafts to search for his daughter. No amount of money, though, could buy him patience when it came to dealing with the Kenyan government. He wrote in his book The Animals Are Innocent, The Search for Julie's Kill killers, that the methods the country's police force employed were both unprofessional and outright bizarre. For example, about a month after finding Julie's remains in the reserve, two Kenyan police investigators showed up to John's hotel room in Nairobi and handed him a plastic grocery bag with a skull inside.

    "text": "The inquest lasted for almost three months and ended in late October 1989, with the magistrate in charge ultimately concluding that Julie had been murdered, period. He ordered that the Kenyan authorities investigate her case as a homicide moving forward. Some of the big things he expressed that didn't add up to him were where Julie's Jeep had been found, where the missing can of fuel had ended up, and the clearly intentional injuries to her body. He told the court that he believed the vehicle might have been planted by her killer or killers, and that it was possible someone other than Julie had transported the can of reserve fuel from the jeep to the burn site and then carried it away. Regarding the state of Julie's remains when they were found, he said, quote, I can only come to the conclusion that those sharp cuts were man-made and not animal-made. I think the animals are innocent, end quote. The magistrate also said he knew the wards were going to continue to be highly suspicious of Simon Olimakala, the game warden who'd found Julie's remains. But the magistrate emphasized that if Simon was somehow involved, it was unusual that he would have wanted to be the person who led people to the burn site.",

    "text": "In my opinion, I think that's debatable. I mean, we know from looking at some true crime cases that involved parties can sometimes be right in the middle of an investigation, if not the person who relishes in finding remains or clues. Anyway, the magistrate officially labeling the case as a murder, though, wasn't total vindication for John Ward. The court had made it clear that even though murder was the most likely scenario, there had not been a coverup. Therefore, the magistrate wasn't going to refer the case to the attorney general's office for further investigation on the matter. John didn't feel confident that police in Kenya were really going to work Julie's case though, so he continued to carry out his own investigation. He traveled back and forth from England and kept trying to track down all the people who'd been staying at Sand River Camp on the day she disappeared. Those efforts sent him and those who were helping him to Spain, Canada, Australia, Sweden, and even the United States trying to track down witnesses and conduct interviews. He posted a £10000 pound reward for information that might lead to an arrest. That amount then would have had the buying power today of over 33,000 US dollars, so it was a lot of money in 1989. After the inquest, it appears things in the case, at least in Kenya, went quiet for a while. But back in Great Britain, John kept being vocal about getting justice for his daughter. He called on people involved in England's political scene who had power and influence. Around this time, the U.S. issued an advisory classifying Kenya as an unsafe destination, and reports of other international tourists being attacked and killed while visiting the country also began to surface. For example, in the summer of 1989, just a few weeks before the inquest into Julie's murder ended, a foreign conservationist and two Kenyan workers in a park were shot and killed by criminals from Somalia. Another group was also reported to have been attacked and murdered around that same time. But it was speculated that Kenyan officials didn't necessarily want word of those incidents to circulate in the press because the tourism industry was such an economic driver for the country. By January and February of 1990, John's personal efforts to keep the spotlight on his daughter's case paid off. Scotland Yard launched an official investigation into the murder and actually sent three inspectors to Kenya to poke around and gather police files.",

    "text": "An article by Michael Horsnell stated that forensic tests were being done by British investigators at that time as part of the investigation into the men, but the article didn't specify what specific items of evidence were being tested. Later reporting by Sam Kiley mentioned that several Caucasian hairs had been found in huts that the defendants and another ranger lived in at the reserve. An article by Richard Caseby said what had gotten the whole ball rolling and resulted in the game wardens being arrested in the first place was that someone had sent John Ward an anonymous letter in England claiming to know where some of Julie's personal belongings ended up in Kenya after her murder. I have to presume that tip pointed toward the two park rangers or else investigators wouldn't have been so heavily focused on them. Anyway, Scotland Yard's theory at that point was entirely circumstantial, but it went like this. Julie willingly sought help from the two park rangers while they were patrolling on foot on September 6th, 1988. But then something went south, and she was held for a few days at their ranger outpost where they sexually assaulted her and killed her. To cover up their crime, the men dismembered her body and burned her remains in the savannah in a different location than where her jeep was found. John Ward mostly agreed with this theory, but he was also convinced that Kenyan officials higher up in the government had played a role in the seemingly corrupt and questionable events that followed the murder. Kenya's attorney general took a look at Scotland Yard's theory and reviewed evidence that allegedly supported it. Something he noted as interesting was that a button-sized solar-powered battery that had been discovered at the ranger's outpost after the crime was the type of battery that Julie's missing Olympus camera would have taken. When it was found, it was resting on a coin in the sun. That position was one way to build up a charge, a fact that seemingly its owner would have known. And because Scotland Yard determined that none of the rangers owned an Olympus camera or knew how to charge a battery like that, it almost seemed as if Julie had left it at the outpost herself, perhaps with the intention of coming back to get it.",

She and John were allowed to grieve in private after the tour ended for the day and the defendants were escorted out of the area. Not long after that, the murder trial abruptly paused so that another case could go before the court. It was scheduled to resume at a later date, and I guess this is just something that happens within the Kenya court system. I'm not familiar with a situation like this happening, but regardless, John Ward was once again unhappy with the way Kenya's court system chose to operate. He told The Guardian, quote, it is really quite disgraceful. This trial has assumed second league importance. It's really quite pathetic.

His adult daughter and several members of the Maasai tribe celebrated the news outside of the courthouse. John Ward was not happy, though. He claimed that the assessors had been influenced and directly contacted by Simon throughout the trial, and that the proceedings had been fundamentally flawed due to corruption.

    "text": "By 2012, John Ward firmly believed that a prominent political player, who he referred to as Mr. B, was the mastermind behind Julie's murder. He wrote a lengthy article for the March 2012 issue of Nairobi Law Monthly titled Mr. B Killed Julie, in which he laid out his entire theory. I wasn't able to get my hands on a copy of that piece for this episode, but Grace Misilla wrote about it in her book and explained that John was very convinced this well-known figure called the shots when it came to why Julie was killed and how her murder was covered up. John had previously told reporter Kate Alderson that at one point he'd interviewed the political figure's driver, who said he'd witnessed Julie's murder after she'd accidentally come across a group of gun and drug smugglers in the reserve and been killed because she'd seen something she shouldn't have. But John's accusations about this Mr. B didn't result in that guy getting charged with anything. It did prompt the man to issue a public denial to Kenyan newspapers though, which I have to assume Mr. B did anonymously since I couldn't find his true identity reported anywhere. When John was previously interviewed by The Nation in 2011, he told reporters that he was absolutely convinced a conspiracy was to blame for why his daughter's murder had never been solved.

But in the end, you are one individual against a state, and it is not easy, end quote.",
